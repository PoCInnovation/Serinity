# Introduction
Serinity is a simple mind letter recognition system made to discover EEG by 3 students, or in other term, it transposes the letter we think about (Visually as an image) into an extern program.\
This program can mainly serve as a documentation and a good start to EEG and brainwaves analysis now and less as a pratical use.\
We'll trace our path to get everything we came accross for a better understanding and I hope a better approch to make this abordable.

⚠️ The used trained model (IA) might not work correctly on other people due to our lack of data. This can surely be upgraded using crossfit training and wider data.

## What does our program do concretely ?


## How it works
The program itself get the data from the headset using [LSL](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/intro.html), preprocesses and then process it using a CNN model.
